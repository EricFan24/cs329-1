CS|LING|QTM 329 - Computational Linguistics
=====

This course focuses on the analysis of plain text, syntactic and semantic structures, ontologies and taxonomies, as well as their applications in computational linguistics.
For text analysis, regular expressions and n-gram models are discussed.
For syntactic analysis, constituency and dependency grammars are discussed.
For semantic analysis, predicate argument structures and abstract meaning representation are discussed.
Computational lexicons such as Treebank, PropBank, WordNet, and FrameNet as well as advanced topics such as document clustering and distributional semantics are also discussed with a focus on their applications. 
Homework assignments may involve big data processing using cloud computing.
